LEG-LOGS
========

PCB adapters / breakout boards are expensive... combat the nonsense with LEG LOGS!

Is that the only reason? Nope...

* I would rather have drawers full of components, than drawers full of adapters
* Too many widths: narrow, standard, wide, super-wide, rediculously-wide, wide-like-a-deck-of-cards-wide, etc.
* I would like the option to recycle or re-purpose adapters
* Working with small-pitch components can be frustrating


##WARNING
You're going to have to be careful with the IC / boards once mounted. The open-gap design is fairly delicate compared to a single solid board.


##Versions
* SOIC / SSOP
